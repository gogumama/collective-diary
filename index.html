			<b>THIS WEEK WE ARE SWITCHING IT UP! </b> We will meet at the New Haven Green in solidarity with Stop the Sweeps! People are camping overnight to demand that city officials stop destroying the living situations of the unhoused population of New Haven! There's a community meal and teach-in at 5:30 and it'll go all night. Art supplies will be there at 7.
			<br><br>
			Usually: hybrid in-person and virtual open space to make art, some supplies available, no need to come with an idea in mind. Held at an art studio in Fair Haven.
